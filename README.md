# Unsupervised-Learning
In unsupervised learning:
- We can have control over input variables but we do not have dependent variable or control over output variable.
- We have unlabelled data
- Emerging patterns based on similar characteristics or properties.
- Examples: Movie recommendations such as Netflix; Market basket analysis and so on...
# Clustering Technique
- Clustering is a part of unsupervised learning. It is the technique of grouping objects, with heterogeneity between the groups and homogeneity within the groups.
- It can follow agglomerative, divisive or partitioning approach.
-	Distance calculations are done to find similarity and dissimilarity in clustering problems. 
-	The main objective of clustering technique is that 'Sum of squares between the clusters'[SSB] > [SSW] 'Sum of squares within the clusters'.
